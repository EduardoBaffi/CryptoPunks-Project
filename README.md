# CryptoPunks-Project

Project about the market of cryptopunks, a collection of 10,000 NFT (Non-fungible token),which are traded on the Ethereum blockchain platform.
The study was developed in Python and included Machine Learning (descriptive, supervised, non supervised analyses). The objetive was to discover price patterns in Punks prices and wider market characteristics.

The first step of the project was to obtain all the data provided by the official websites of this market, in order to store all the information in a structured way. From there, the data obtained has been properly treated, prepared and statistically explore each of the existing variables.

The main objective has been to check if the price of cryptopunks is the same for all of them or there are price differences between the different subgroups. If the analysis focuses on the absolutely majority types of cryptopunkstypes ("Male" and "Female"), the conclusion is that there are no statistically significant price differences between skin types. In any case, cryptopunks that have a higher profit due to their last sell operation, are the "Male" type with "Mid-skinned" skin and 3 traits ("traits_count"). Likewise, the more liquid cryptopunks (which have been subject to a greater number of sales transactions), are the most suitable for investors.
